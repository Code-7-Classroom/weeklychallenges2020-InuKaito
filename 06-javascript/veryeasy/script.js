// VERY EASY: Create two variables and assign a number to each. Example output: 
// Console log the difference between the numbers.
// “The difference between 6 and 2 is 4”
var num1 = 10;
var num2 = 15;
var diffence = (num2 - num1);
console.log('The diffence between ' + num2  + ' and ' +  num1 + ' is ' + diffence);
