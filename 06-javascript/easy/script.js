// EASY: Create two variables and assign a person’s name to each.
// Console log a statement that says which name is shorter or longer, and by how many characters.
// Example output: “The name Thomas is longer than John by 2 characters"
var firstName = 'nathan';
var secondName = 'alan';
var num3 = 2;
console.log('The name ' + firstName + ' is longer than ' + secondName + ' by ' + num3 + ' characters');
